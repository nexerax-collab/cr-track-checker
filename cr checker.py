1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure you have installed the required Python libraries. You'll need a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with:
    ```
    streamlit
    PyPDF2
    google-generativeai
    ```
    Install them locally using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  **Google API Key:** Obtain a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * **Local Run:** Set it as an environment variable before running the app (e.g., `export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"` on Linux/macOS, or `set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"` on Windows).
    * **Streamlit Cloud Deployment:** Add it as a "secret" named `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your app's settings on Streamlit Cloud.
